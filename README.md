# Python Debugging Assistant - AI Prompt Design

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive AI prompt design for helping students debug Python code without directly providing solutions. The project is organized into three main components:

### ðŸ“‹ File Structure

- **[`prompt.md`](./prompt.md)** - The complete AI debugging assistant prompt ready to use
- **[`design_reasoning.md`](./design_reasoning.md)** - Detailed explanation of design choices and educational theory
- **[`examples.md`](./examples.md)** - Practical examples showing the prompt in action with different skill levels

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

The AI debugging assistant is designed to:

1. **Guide students** toward discovering bugs themselves rather than providing direct solutions
2. **Adapt to different skill levels** from beginner to advanced programmers
3. **Build debugging skills** that students can use independently
4. **Maintain encouragement** while providing educational value
5. **Focus on understanding** the "why" behind problems, not just the "what"

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

To use the debugging assistant prompt:

1. Open [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md)
2. Copy the prompt text
3. Paste it into your preferred AI language model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. Follow with the student's buggy Python code
5. The AI will guide the debugging process using educational best practices

### ðŸ“š Key Features

**Adaptive Response System:**
- Automatically adjusts complexity based on code sophistication
- Uses different vocabulary and examples for beginners vs. advanced learners
- Balances guidance vs. direct identification (80/20 split)

**Educational Methodology:**
- Question-first approach following Socratic method
- Encourages systematic thinking and testing
- Builds metacognitive awareness
- Focuses on process over product

**Practical Debugging Techniques:**
- Suggests print statements for visibility
- Encourages step-by-step code tracing
- Promotes testing with simple inputs
- Teaches error message interpretation

## ðŸ“‹ Submission Checklist

- [x] **Prompt is clear, specific, and well-structured** - Complete prompt provided in [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md)
- [x] **Reasoning is thoughtful and well-articulated** - Comprehensive analysis in [`design_reasoning.md`](./design_reasoning.md)  
- [x] **Includes reasoning answers** - All required questions answered with educational theory backing
- [x] **Practical examples provided** - Multiple scenarios demonstrated in [`examples.md`](./examples.md)

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

This repository contains the AI debugging assistant prompt design for Python Screening Task 2. All files are self-contained markdown documents:

1. **For immediate use**: Copy the prompt from [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) into any AI language model
2. **For understanding**: Read the detailed reasoning in [`design_reasoning.md`](./design_reasoning.md)
3. **For examples**: See practical applications in [`examples.md`](./examples.md)

No additional setup or dependencies required - the prompt is ready to use immediately.

## ðŸŽ“ Educational Impact

This prompt design is based on proven educational methodologies:
- **Constructivism** - Students build understanding through active engagement
- **Zone of Proximal Development** - Providing just enough help to enable learning
- **Socratic Method** - Learning through guided questioning
- **Growth Mindset** - Emphasizing learning and improvement over correctness
