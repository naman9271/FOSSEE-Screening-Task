# Python Debugging Assistant - AI Prompt Design Task - 2

### Quick Start

To use the debugging assistant prompt:

1. Open [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md)
2. Copy the prompt text
3. Paste it into your preferred AI language model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. Follow with the student's buggy Python code
5. The AI will guide the debugging process using educational best practices

## Summary

This repository contains the AI debugging assistant prompt design for Python Screening Task 2. All files are self-contained markdown documents:

1. **For immediate use**: Copy the prompt from [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) into any AI language model
2. **For understanding**: Read the detailed reasoning in [`design_reasoning.md`](./design_reasoning.md)
3. **For examples**: See practical applications in [`examples.md`](./examples.md)
